<p>Start the class off right, devoting more of the class time to introducing the
course content instead of the course policies. And get students doing something
with data as quickly as possible. A personal goal of mine is 10 minutes from
beginning of class to the first data visualization students produce! The
application exercise in this lecture is one way of achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Lecture slides are below and you can find the source code for the slides <a href="https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/tree/master/slides/u0_d01-welcome">here</a>.
The application exercise can be found <a href="/appex/ae-01-un-votes/ae-01-un-votes.html">here</a>, and
you can also access the source R Markdown file for the application exercise
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/tree/master/appex/ae-01-un-votes">here</a> on GitHub
