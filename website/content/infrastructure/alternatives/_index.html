<p>In this section we describe alternative setups for your course.</p>
<div id="rstudio-without-rstudio-cloud" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio (without RStudio Cloud)</h2>
<p>In a course at this level students should access the RStudio IDE through a
centralized RStudio server instance, which allows us to provide students with
uniform computing environments.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the goal isn’t to completely dissuade students from
downloading and installing R and RStudio locally, we just don’t want it to be a
prerequisite for getting started. Teaching personal setup is best done
progressively throughout a semester, usually via one-on-one interactions during
office hours or after class. The goal is that all students will be able to
continue using R even if they no longer have access to departmental resources.</p>
<p>If you prefer to not use RStudio Cloud, you might consider one of the following
approaches.</p>
<div id="centralized-rstudio-server" class="section level3">
<h3>Centralized RStudio server</h3>
<p>One approach that might work particularly well for higher level courses that
require a shared infrastructure and higher end computational resources is
running academically licensed RStudio Server Pro on a powerful server (e.g.
32 cores, 512 GB RAM). If this server is in the department, instructors can be
given direct control over all aspects of the computing environment.</p>
<p>The figure below is a sketch of the architecture of the centralized RStudio
server approach, which shows that students connect to a single RStudio server
instance via a departmental login. This works well for upper division and
graduate level courses as most students are directly affiliated with the
department. Students taking courses who are not affiliated with the department
are issued temporary visitor accounts which expire at the end of the semester.</p>

<p>More modest configurations can be more than adequate (e.g., a mid-to-high end
desktop) for the vast majority of use cases, however care should be given when
working with larger datasets in a shared environment. An alternative approach
is to use a virtualized hardware in the cloud (e.g. EC2, Azure, etc.).</p>
<p>The primary benefit of running and managing the server in-house comes down to
control - as needed the instructor(s) are able to install and update software,
change configurations, restart or kill sessions, and monitor all aspects of the
system. This does increase the demands on the instructor and any involved IT
staff, but we have found the benefits to far outweigh the costs. One other
unforeseen benefit to a centralized approach is that it makes it possible to
present large scale analytic tasks that would not be possible on a traditional
desktop or laptop. For example, advanced courses can include homework
assignments where students need to process a dataset that is on the order of
several hundred gigabytes in size, which would not be possible if they were
required to use their own system.</p>

<h3>Dockerized RStudio server</h3>
<p>A second approach to running RStudio server involves the construction and
hosting of a farm of individualized Docker container instances. A sketch of the
architecture of the Docker containers is in the figure below, which shows that
students authenticate via university login which redirects them to a personal
RStudio instance running in a Docker container on either a local or cloud based
server.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Dockerized RStudio server</p>
</div>
<p>Docker is a popular and rapidly evolving containerization tool suite that allows
users to automate the deployment of software in a repeatable and self-contained
way. Each container wraps a portion of the file system in such a way that all of
the code, runtimes, tools, and libraries needed for a piece of software are
available, meaning that software will always run in exactly the same way
regardless of the environment in which it is being run. As such, Docker is a
powerful tool for reproducible computational research, since every Dockerfile
transparently and clearly defines exactly what software and which version is
being used for any particular computation task.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of Docker containers is that they are similar to virtual
machines in that they are sandboxed from one another. By mapping each student to
a single container we are able to keep all student processes segregated and
enforce strict CPU, memory, and disk usage quotas to avoid accidental disruption
of the work of one another.</p>
<p>However Docker containers are generally lighter weight than virtual machines, in
terms of system resources used. This makes it feasible to run a large number of
containers on a single system at the same time. Since most RStudio usage
(particularly by our introductory students) is intermittent, we have found that
it is possible to run more than 100 RStudio containers concurrently on a single
server. Servers can be run locally or on a cloud-based service. The cost for
the latter can be defrayed by the credits many services offer for academic use.</p>
<p>Further details of a containerized RStudio server approach implemented at Duke
can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mccahill/docker-rstudio">here</a>. This
repository contains a README which explains how the large-scale container farm
is set up and also contains the Dockerfiles that are used to create the
individual containers.</p>
<p>Implementing the infrastructure solutions discussed above can be overwhelming
and time consuming. We encourage faculty interested in adopting these tools to
partner with their departmental and/or university IT professionals. Additionally,
building these partnerships can lead to collaborations that benefit the entire
university.</p>
