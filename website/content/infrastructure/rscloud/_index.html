<p>The RStudio IDE includes a viewable environment, a file browser, data viewer,
and a plotting pane, which makes it less intimidating than the bare R shell.
Additionally, since it is a full fledged IDE, it also features integrated help,
syntax highlighting, and context-aware tab completion, which are all powerful
tools that help flatten the learning curve.</p>
<p><a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a> is a managed cloud instance of the
RStudio IDE. We recommend having students access RStudio via RStudio Cloud
as opposed to using a local installation. The main reason for this choice is
reducing friction at first exposure to R. Local installation can be difficult
to manage, both for the student and the instructor, and can shift the focus
away from data science learning at the beginning of the course. In the
pedagogical decisions section we discuss in further detail the reasons for
avoiding local installation at the beginning of the course and discuss when
to introduce it later on in the course.</p>
<p>When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own,
and the projects you create here are public to RStudio Cloud members. You can
also add a new workspace and control its permissions, and the projects you
create here can be public or private.</p>
<p>All student facing materials for this course have been organized in an RStudio
Cloud workspace <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/1655/join?access_code=6fbqA1UcHm0rLmdhjyQahLIBzMy%2FNt0P4Wmlx1TG">here</a>. Soon you will have the option to copy that workspace and
use it to organize assignments and assessments. [Note: The workspace is currently
work in progress, rest of the materials will be added soon.]</p>
<p>A natural way to set up a course in RStudio Cloud is using a private workspace.
In this structure a classroom (a cohort of students in one semester of the course)
maps to a workspace. Once a workspace is set up, instructors can invite students
to the workspace via an invite link. Workspaces allow for various permission
levels which can be assigned to students, teaching assistants, and instructors.
Then, each assignment/project in the course maps to an RStudio Cloud project.</p>

<div id="setting-up-your-course-in-rstudio-cloud" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up your course in RStudio Cloud</h2>
<p>First, create a new workspace on RStudio Cloud. By default, this new workspace
will be a private workspace. All it takes to create a new workspace is a name
and brief information for the space. You can update the information once the
space is created, however you can’t change the name of the space. For the name,<br />
I recommend using something along the lines of Course number - Semester.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-new-workspace.png" alt="Creating a new workspace on RStudio Cloud" />
<p class="caption">Creating a new workspace on RStudio Cloud</p>
</div>
<p>Next step is to invite members to the workspace. You can do this by sending
invitations or using a sharing link. I recommend using the latter approach
for efficiency. Once all of your students are in the course (or once drop/add
period ends) you can change the settings so that additional members cannot join
throughout the semester using the sharing link, and can only be added via an
invitation from the instructor.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-workspace-permissions.png" alt="Setting workspace permissions" />
<p class="caption">Setting workspace permissions</p>
</div>
<p>As highlighted in the figure above, when a workspace is set to accept members
via a shared link, the owner can also set a default permission level for those
entering the workspace via the sharing link. Suggested permission levels and
suggestions for mapping to course roles are as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>RStudio Cloud role</th>
<th>Permissions</th>
<th>Course role</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Admin</td>
<td>Manage users, view, edit and manage all projects</td>
<td>Instructor</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Moderator</td>
<td>View, edit and manage all projects</td>
<td>Teaching Assistant</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Contributor</td>
<td>Create, edit and manage their own projects</td>
<td>Student</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Viewer</td>
<td>View projects shared with everyone</td>
<td>Auditor, Visitor</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This set of permissions will allow instructors full access including management
of users. Teaching assistants will be able to peek into student projects, which
can be very useful when helping troubleshoot. Students won’t be able to see
each others’ projects. Students auditing your course or visitors, such as
colleagues wanting to view/experience your course setup will have limited
access.</p>
<p>RStudio Cloud also allows you to specify who can see the list of members. Admins
and moderators can, by default, see all members of the workspace. I prefer to
allow contributors (students) to see the list of members and viewers (auditors
and visitors) to not since course enrollment information should not be
available to non-official members of the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>A project in RStudio Cloud is equivalent to an RStudio project. If you are an
RStudio user, but you don’t use projects, I highly recommend considering
switching your workflow to include projects. You can learn more about them
<a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects">here</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="access" class="section level3">
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>When you create a new project in your workspace, it is by default visible
only to you plus the admins and moderators of the space. This default has two
advantages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It allows you to develop a project semi-privately and actively decide when
the project is ready to be shared with students. This can be especially
beneficial when developing an assessment like an exam.</li>
<li>It means when a student creates a project in the workspace it’s not, by
default, visible to other students.</li>
</ol>
<p>When your project is ready to be shared with the students in your course, you
can adjust the access level by clicking on the gear icon to reveal the
settings menu.</p>

</div>
<div id="copying" class="section level3">
<h3>Copying</h3>
<p>When a student clicks on your shared project, they are notified that this is
a temporary copy (with red blinking text), and are given the option to make
their own permanent copy of the project. This is the first thing a student
should do when they start working on a project.</p>
<p>When a student makes a copy of a project, a new project where they are the
owner and that is only visible to them (and the admins and moderators of the
space) is created. This copy contains all documents included in the
original project and has all the packages installed (but not loaded) as well.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-project-copy.png" alt="Making a copy of a project" />
<p class="caption">Making a copy of a project</p>
</div>
<p>You will see in the above screenshot that the user (on the right) is not
the admin of the course. This screenshot was taken when logged into the demo
workspace as a student (contributor). I strongly recommend that instructors make
a second account for themselves on RStudio Cloud and add that user as a
contributor to the workspace to be see what your students see when they log in.
It’s a great way to test out functionality and resolve unexpected issues
your students might encounter, before they encounter them. I recommend using an
incognito browser window for the student account so that you can stay logged in
both as a student and as the instructor at the same time and test the student
view as you develop content as an instructor.</p>
<p>One huge advantage of your students working in RStudio Cloud is that you as the
instructor, and anyone with an admin and moderator role, can peek into student
projects. While it is important for your students to learn to ask questions in
a way that does not depend on someone else being able to see their work directly
(and for this I strongly recommend teaching students to make
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex">reprexes</a>), it is sometimes, especially
early on, nice to be able to peek into a student’s project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="base-project-template" class="section level2">
<h2>Base project template</h2>
<p>If you consistently use a particular set of packages and/or need a particular
set of documents to be included in each project, the base project template
functionality will come in very handy. You can use this by defining a base
project template for the space. Simply create a new project and add any packages
or files you want projects created in the space to start with. After creating
your project, select it on the Settings page as the base project template.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-base-template.png" alt="Selecting a base project template" />
<p class="caption">Selecting a base project template</p>
</div>
<p>Note that a project must be shared with everyone in the space in order to be
used as a template; only projects which are viewable by everyone in the space
will appear in the templates list.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-integration" class="section level2">
<h2>Git integration</h2>
<p>It is possible to create (clone) a new project in RStudio Cloud from a GitHub
repository, just like in the RStudio IDE.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../../images/rscloud-git-project.png" alt="Creating a new project from GitHub repository" />
<p class="caption">Creating a new project from GitHub repository</p>
</div>
<p>If you have a base project template set up for your workspace, this new project
created from GitHub will also have the packages installed in the base project
template.</p>

</div>
<div id="limits" class="section level2">
<h2>Limits</h2>
<div id="memory" class="section level3">
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Each project on RStudio Cloud is allocated 1 GB of RAM. While this is a pretty
generous limit, actions like joining large tables or fitting complicated
models could exceed the limit.</p>
<p>I recommend testing out the any work you assign, especially those using large
datasets, in order to avoid unexpected hiccups due to out of memory issues. One
challenge is that you might have no control over what issues students might run
into if they are working on an open ended project using a dataset of their own
choice. In these circumstances it’s helpful to keep in the back of your mind
that one way an out of memory issue can present itself is with the RStudio Cloud
project crashing.</p>
</div>
<div id="users-projects" class="section level3">
<h3>Users / projects</h3>
<p>Another limit that you will most likely hit when setting up your course on
RStudio Cloud is that each account is allocated one private space, with up to
three members and five projects. Once you hit this limit RStudio Cloud will
prompt you to submit a request to the RStudio Cloud team for more capacity.
Rest assured that this request will be approved.</p>
