<p>One of the design principles of this course is “cherish day one” – get students
from nothing to their first meaningful data visualization within the first 10 minutes
of the course. Achieving this is possible, but requires careful consideration of
the computing infrastructure. This section outlines how one can set up their
course to run on RStudio Cloud, use GitHub for not only version control and
collaboration but also the learning management system for the course, build their
course materials with packages from the *down universe (rmarkdown, blogdown,
xaringan, etc.), and use Slack for course communication. Lastly, the alternative
setups section describes other approaches to setting up the computing infrastructure
that can be just as efficient and effective as the ones described in the main
choices for the course, and discusses pros and cons.</p>
