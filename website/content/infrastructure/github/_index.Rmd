One of the defining principles behind how this course teaches computing is that 
everything the instructor and the students produce should be reproducible -- how 
you get a result is just as important as the result itself. Implicit in the idea 
of reproducibility is collaboration, the code you produce is documentation of 
the process and it is critical to share it (even if only with yourself in the 
future). One of the goals of this course is to teach students tools that make 
this documentation and collaboration as robust and painless as possible. This is 
best accomplished with a distributed version control system like Git

This course adopts a top down approach to teaching Git -- students are 
*required* to use it for *all* assignments. These type of tools tend to suffer 
from delayed gratification as when they are first introduced students view them 
as a clunky addition to their workflow and it is not until weeks or even months 
later that they experience the value first hand.

If this section doesn't convince you that you should be using Git and GitHub in 
your data science course, the section on [alternative setups]() describes how 
to leverage RStudio Cloud features for assignment dissemination, collection, and 
providing feedback. You can also use your own institution's learning management 
system for this purpose as well.

## Git

Learning Git is a steep hill to climb, but with appropriate and user friendly 
tooling and careful pedagogy, being able to use core functionality of git for 
the purposes of version control in a data analysis context doesn't have to be.

The learning curve for Git is unavoidable but I have found it best to focus on 
core functionality. Specifically, I teach a simple centralized git workflow 
which uses RStudio's project based git GUI. Each new assignment starts with 
creating a new project from git (i.e. `clone`), the RStudio git GUI continuously 
displays git `status` and allows users to `add`, `rm`, `commit`, `push`, and 
`pull`. These happen to be the most commonly used git commands, and using only 
these students will be able to do most of what they need to do to work and 
collaborate on assignments and submit them.

However it is not unusual for students to mangle their repositories such that 
the command line tools become necessary, and when this happens, the instruction 
team can help students get out of the rut. 

The most complicated task students regularly encounter are merge conflicts, 
most of which are straight forward to resolve. Students often develop elaborate 
workflows to avoid these types of issues but they eventually come to understand 
the resolution process. 

It is super important to encourage students to **commit early and often** to reduce 
the size of each change. Finally, in the early stages of learning git it is 
useful to engineer situations in which students encounter problems while they 
are in the classroom so that the professor and teaching assistants are present 
to troubleshoot and walk them through the process in person. A sample activity 
for resolving merge conflicts is provided in the course materials.

## GitHub

The use of GitHub also goes a long way to help students visualize and understand 
the git process which also aids in student buy-in. The web interface allows 
students to easily view diffs (file changes over time) in files they are 
collaborating on, keep track of commit histories, and search both the current 
state as well as the entire history of the code base. Within the classroom 
GitHub can be thought of as an advanced and flexible learning management system 
(compared to traditional tools like Blackboard or Sakai).

At its most basic, GitHub can be used as a central repository where students turn 
in their work and where the professor and teaching assistants then collect it and 
provide feedback. However using this ecosystem for only assignment submission 
ignores the most compelling features and advantages. In our classes students are 
expected to push their work in progress throughout the assignment period. This 
is not enforced explicitly, but rather through the design of the assignments. 
Most assignments are large scale and team based, meaning no one student can 
easily complete all the work on their own. In addition, the various tasks within 
the assignment are interdependent, meaning students are not able to divide up 
the work and complete each piece individually. This type of design strongly 
encourages the students to share their work in progress which they are able to do 
using GitHub. This is also useful to the instructor as it allows for opportunities 
for observation and feedback through the course of the assignment without forcing 
students to turn in "drafts".

Additionally, GitHub's organization and teams features are a natural fit for 
managing course related tasks. We have used a model where each class has a 
separate organization to which the students are invited at the beginning of 
the semester. Students have individual and team personas on GitHub, and are given 
write access to repos for assignments accordingly, depending on whether the 
assignment is to be completed individually or in teams.

In general, I have found that using one repository per team per assignment works 
best. This creates a LOT of repositories by the end of the semester, but that's 
okay! In order to comply with Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 
requirements all student repositories are kept private by default, which is 
possible at no cost thanks to GitHub's generous academic discount policy. 

Setup and management for larger classes can be challenging due to the sheer 
number of components, however most actions can be scripted via the GitHub API 
which can dramatically reduce the course administrative workload. Two solutions 
to this problem are (1) GitHub Classroom and (2) ghclass. Use of ghclass, an R 
package for GitHub classroom tools is detailed below, and use of GitHub 
classroom is described in the [alternative setups] section.

## Instructions for assignment getting started and "submission" via Git

Here are the steps for getting started:

- Go to the classroom GitHub organization and grab the link of the assignment 
repo.
- Start a new RStudio project from Git cloning this repository
- Make any changes needed as outlined by the tasks you need to complete for the 
assignment
- Make sure all your code chunks are informatively named, and these labels are 
not repeated
- Periodically commit changes (the more often the better, for example, once per 
each new task)
- Push all your changes back to your GitHub repo

and voila, you're done! Once you push your changes back you do not need to do 
anything else to "submit" your work. And you can of course push multiple times 
throughout the assignment. At the time of the deadline we will take whatever 
is in your repo and consider it your final submission, and grade the state of 
your work at that time (which means even if you made mistakes before then, 
you wouldn't be penalized for them as long as the final state of your work is 
correct).

## Continuous integration and badges

Something new on this homework, and going forward on class assignments. Each time you push to GitHub a continuous integration tool (called wercker) will check to make sure your Rmd knits successfully. If it does, you'll be able to see a badge on the README of your repo that says "build passing" (in green). If it fails, it'll say "build failing" (in orange). If the build is failing you will need to fix your Rmd so that it knits without any errors and then push again. Some tips:

- You should avoid leaving your repo in a failing stage. 
- You can click on the "build failing" badge to get more information.
- A "build passing" badge is not guarantee that your work is correct, but instead just that your Rmd file knits.

lab getting started

# Getting started

- Go to the course organization on GitHub: https://github.com/Sta199-S18.

- Find the repo starting with `lab-03` and that has your team name at the end (this should be the only `lab-03` repo available to you).

- In the repo, click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the course workspace. Create a **New Project from Git Repo**. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the **New Project** button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box:

- Hit OK, and you're good to go!

Also for labs

# Housekeeping

## Git configuration

```{marginfigure}
Your email address is the address tied to your GitHub account and your name should be first and last name.
```

- Go to the *Terminal* pane
- Type the following two lines of code, replacing the information in the quotation marks with your info.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config --global user.name "your name"
```

To confirm that the changes have been implemented, run the following:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email
git config --global user.name
```

## Password caching

If you would like your git password cached for a week for this project, type the following in the Terminal:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

## Project name: 

Currently your project is called *Untitled Project*. Update the name of your project to be "Lab 05 - Simpson's paradox".

# Warm up

**Pick one team member to complete the steps in this section while the others contribute to the discussion but do not actually touch the files on their computer.**

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

## YAML: 

Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your **team** name, and knit the document.

## Commiting and pushing changes:

- Go to the **Git** pane in your RStudio. 
- View the **Diff** and confirm that you are happy with the changes.
- Add a commit message like "Update team name" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.
- Click on **Push**. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password.

## Pulling changes:

Now, the remaining team members who have not been concurrently making these changes on their projects should click on the **Pull** button in their Git pane and observe that the changes are now reflected on their projects as well.
