The course content is organized in three units:

```{r topic-flow, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(path = "../../images/topic-flow.jpeg")
```

**Unit 1 - Exploring data: ** This unit focuses on data visualization and data 
wrangling. Specifically we cover fundamentals of data and data visualization, 
confounding variables, and Simpson's paradox as well as the concept of tidy 
data, data import, data cleaning, and data curation. We end the unit with web 
scraping and introduce the idea of iteration in preparation for the next unit. 
Also in this unit students are introduced to the toolkit: R, RStudio, R Markdown, 
Git, GitHub, etc.

**Unit 2 - Making rigorous conclusions:** In this part we introduce modeling and 
statistical inference for making data-based conclusions. We discuss building, 
interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and 
prediction and model validity. Statistical inference is introduced from a 
simulation based perspective, and the Central Limit Theorem is discussed very 
briefly to lay the foundation for future coursework in statistics. 

**Unit 3 - Looking forward:** In the last unit we present a series of modules
such as interactive reporting and visualization with Shiny, text analysis, and 
Bayesian inference. These are independent modules that educators can choose to 
include in their introductory data science curriculum depending on how much time 
they have left in the semester.

The table below outlines a sample course schedule developed for a 15-week long 
semester course that meets twice a week for lecture and once a week for a 
computing lab.
