<p>Hello! And welcome!</p>
<p>There is a little bit of something for everyone (who wants to teach/learn)
data science in this box.</p>
<p>If you are an educator we recommend consuming the content in the order
presented here: first familiarize yourself with the design principles, course
syllabus, and the tech stack, then browse the course content, and then review
the details of the computing infrastructure of the course.</p>
<p>If you are a learner, you might consider jumping straight into the course
content.</p>
