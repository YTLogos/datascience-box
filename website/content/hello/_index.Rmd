Hello! And welcome!

There is a little bit of something for everyone (who wants to teach/learn) 
data science in this box. 

If you are an educator we recommend consuming the content in the order 
presented here: first familiarize yourself with the design principles, course 
syllabus, and the tech stack, then browse the course content, and then review 
the details of the computing infrastructure of the course.

If you are a learner, you might consider jumping straight into the course 
content.
