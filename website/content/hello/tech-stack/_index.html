<p>This course teaches computing and statistics to undergraduates with no background
in either. Managing such a course with students from varied backgrounds doing
non-trivial computational work is a big technical challenge. This page briefly
describes the toolkit choices, and the <a href="/20-infrastructure">infrastructure</a> section
provides a path forward for educators who are considering using these tools for
their own teaching purposes.</p>
<p>While the recommended tech stack is for the entirety of course development is tall,
only a few of the technologies are student facing:</p>
<ul>
<li>RStudio Cloud: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio Cloud</a> is a managed cloud
instance of the RStudio IDE. We recommend having students access RStudio via
RStudio Cloud as opposed to using a local installation.

<li>GitHub: The use of <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> also goes a long way to help
students visualize and understand the git process which also aids in student
buy-in. The web interface allows students to easily view diffs (file changes
over time) in files they are collaborating on, keep track of commit histories,
and search both the current state as well as the entire history of the code
base. Within the classroom GitHub can be thought of as an advanced and flexible
learning management system (compared to traditional tools like Blackboard or Sakai).

<li>Slack: <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a versatile communications and
collaboration tool. Students are discouraged from using email for questions
and discussions related to content of the course, only emails about personal matters
are allowed. Hence most course communication happens on Slack. Both public (for
announcements and general questions) and private (for team communication) channels
are used. <a href="/infrastructure/slack/">[Read more]</a></li>
</ul>
