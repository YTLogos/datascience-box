		<h1>Data Science in a Box</h1>
		<p>How can we effectively and efficiently teach data science to students 
		with little to no background in computing and statistical thinking? How can 
		we equip them with the skills and tools for reasoning with various types 
		of data and leave them wanting to learn more? This introductory data science 
		course is our (working) answer to this question.</p>
		<p>The core content of the course focuses on data acquisition 
		and wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, inference, 
		modeling, and effective communication of results. Time permitting, the 
		course also introduces additional concepts and tools like interactive 
		visualization and reporting, text analysis, and Bayesian inference. 
		A heavy emphasis is placed on a consitent syntax (with tools from the 
		<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>), reproducibility 
		(with <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>), and version 
		control and collaboration (with Git and GitHub). In addition, out-of-class 
		learning is supplemented with interactive <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/">tutorials</a>. The goal of the course is to bring students from 
		zero to being able to work in a team on a fully reproducible 
		data science project analyzing a dataset of their choice and answering 
		questions they care about.</p>
		<p>Data Science in a Box contains the materials required to teach 
		(or learn from) the course described above, all of which are 
		<a href="https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/master/LICENSE.md">freely-available and open-source</a>. They include course 
		materials such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample 
		exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such 
		as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology 
		stack, and course logistics. </p>
