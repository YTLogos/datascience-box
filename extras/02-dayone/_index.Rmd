You only get one first day of class, so start with something that excites 
students, teach the necessary evils later. This means getting to a meaningful, 
and hopefully interesting (for the students) data visualization as quickly 
as possible.

## Learning goals

- Start developing an understanding of what data science is
- Understand course goals, structure, and expectations
- Get motivated to learn more with current and interesting data analyses
- Create and modify first data visualization 

## Outline

- What is data science?
- What is this course?
- Data in the wild
- Application exercise: Visualizing UN votes

### What is data science?

Start with a brief introduction to the course and to data science. It's 
difficult to find a precise definition of data science that many in the field 
agree on. But the following is a good one: "Data science is an exciting 
discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and 
knowledge." We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that 
later!

### What is this course?

Then, spend a little bit of time describing the course content and overall 
learning goals. It is important to emphasize that this is an introductory data 
science course designed for learners with no background in data science, 
programming, or statistics, but a willingness to learn in class and explore independently.

A few questions students might have (and their answers) are below:

- Will we be doing computing? Yes.
- Is this an intro CS course? Not really, but many themes are shared.
- Is this an intro stat course? In a way, but it's not your high school 
statistics course.
- What computing language will we learn? R.
- Why not language X? We can discuss that over :coffee:.

Before moving on, give an overview of assessments -- what form will they take 
and roughly how often will they happen. Do not spend too long going over every 
detail in the syllabus, instead you might consider giving reading the syllabus 
as a homework assignment and give students a mini quiz they can take online,
which you can build with learnr or within your courses management system. I 
usually grade such a quiz on a check / no check basis.

### Data in the wild

I like starting off by showing a few examples of easy to follow but not so 
simple data analyses done in R, preferably presented along with the R code. 
This should be the type of analysis they could do for their final project. 
Blog posts are often good examples for these. In Spring 2018 I used the 
following as examples:

- [A year as told by fitbit](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/12/27/a-year-as-told-by-fitbit/) by Nick Strayer
- [R-Ladies global tour](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/10/06/globalrladiestour/) by Maelle Salmon
- [Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) 
Android half](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) by David Robinson

### Application exercise: Visualizing UN votes

It's now time to let the students work on their first data visualization in R. 

Using the `unvotes` package, and a pre-populated R Markdown document on RStudio 
Cloud, they can create and modify the two multi-variate plots, visualizing the 
voting history of countries in the United Nations General Assembly.

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE}
library(unvotes)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

We will narrow down the analysis to four countries: United States, Russian 
Federation, Mexico, and Turkey.

```{r country-list}
country_list <- c("United States of America", "Russian Federation", 
                  "Mexico", "Turkey")
```

First we take a look at how often each country voted "yes" on a resolution 
in each year.

```{r plot-yearly-yes, warning=FALSE}
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% country_list) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  group_by(year = year(date), country) %>%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
    ) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(
      title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
      subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
      y = "% Yes",
      x = "Year",
      color = "Country"
    )
```

And then, we create a visualization that compares how the voting record of the 
United States changed over time on a variety of issues, and compare it to 
another country.

```{r plot-yearly-yes-issue, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States of America", "Turkey")) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
    ) %>%
  filter(votes > 5) %>%  # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ issue) +
    labs(
      title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
      subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
      y = "% Yes",
      x = "Year",
      color = "Country"
    )
```

At this point, instead of a formal introduction on R syntax, I recommend 
letting students change parameters passed to these functions, such as which 
countries are being plotted, and re-knit the document to view the changes.
