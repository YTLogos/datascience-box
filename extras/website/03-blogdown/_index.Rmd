A nifty tool for building your course website is [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

Perhaps the most useful aspect of blogdown in this setting is that your slides, 
assignments, etc. written in R Markdown can be automatically rendered, so you 
don't need to separate knit those documents.

More instructions on this are forthcoming, but for the time being, you can use 
[this course website](https://github.com/Sta199-S18/website) as an example.
