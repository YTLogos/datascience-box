The RStudio IDE includes a viewable environment, a file browser, data viewer, 
and a plotting pane, which makes it less intimidating than the bare R shell. 
Additionally, since it is a full fledged IDE, it also features integrated help, 
syntax highlighting, and context-aware tab completion, which are all powerful 
tools that help flatten the learning curve.

[RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a managed cloud instance of the 
RStudio IDE. We recommend having students access RStudio via RStudio Cloud 
as opposed to using a local installation. The main reason for this choice is 
reducing friction at first exposure to R. Local installation can be difficult 
to manage, both for the student and the instructor, and can shift the focus 
away from data science learning at the beginning of the course. In the 
pedagogical decisions section we discuss in further detail the reasons for 
avoiding local installation at the beginning of the course and discuss when 
to introduce it later on in the course.

When you create an account on RStudio Cloud you get a workspace of your own, 
and the projects you create here are public to RStudio Cloud members. You can 
also add a new workspace and control its permissions, and the projects you 
create here can be public or private.

All student facing materials for this course have been organized in an RStudio 
Cloud workspace [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/1655/projects). Soon you will 
have the option to copy that workspace and use it to organize assignments and 
assessments.

A natural way to set up a course in RStudio Cloud is using a private workspace. 
In this structure a classroom (a cohort of students in one semester of the course) 
maps to a workspace. Once a workspace is set up, instructors can invite students 
to the workspace via an invite link. Workspaces allow for various permission 
levels which can be assigned to students, teaching assistants, and instructors. 
Then, each assignment/project in the course maps to an RStudio Cloud project.
