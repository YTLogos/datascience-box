## Data visualization with ggplot2

![ggplot2-hex](images/ggplot2.png) is part of the ![tidyverse-hex](images/tidyverse.png)

Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data. There are base graphing capabilities that come with R, but the `ggplot2` package provides vizualizations that are particularly intuitive and customizable. The 'gg' in `ggplot` stands for Grammar of Graphics, the title of a data visualization book by Leland Wilkinson.

To create visualizations in `ggplot2`, you provide the `ggplot` function with a data frame, map variables from the data frame to `aes`thetic elements of the plot, and add on `geom`etric objects to represent the data points.

The terminology might be difficult to follow at first, but let's see if we can clarify things a bit with an example.

Here's an example using the `msleep` dataset, which contains information on mammals' sleep times and weights. Let's take a look at the data frame:

```{r print-msleep}
msleep
```

```{r num-var-obs, echo = F}
quiz(
  caption = "Your turn!",
  question("How many observations are in this data frame?",
    answer("4"),
    answer("10"),
    answer("11"),
    answer("83", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
    ),
  question("How many variables are in this data frame?",
    answer("4"),
    answer("10"),
    answer("11", correct = TRUE),
    answer("83"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

To visualize the relationship between how daily sleep amount (in hours) and lentgh of sleep cycle (in hours) we map the `sleep_total` variable to `x` and the `sleep_cycle` variable to `y`. Then we specify that we want each data point to be represented by a point with `geom_point`.

Hit **Run Code** to view the plot.

```{r msleep-sleep_total-sleep_cycle, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = sleep_total, y = sleep_cycle)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note the warning: `Removed 51 rows containing missing values (geom_point).`. This means that 51 observations had missing values for `sleep_total` or `sleep_cycle` (or both), and hence are not displayed on this plot.

## The data: Star Wars

In this tutorial we will work with the `starwars` data frame. Each row in this data frame represents a character from the Star Wars franchise and the columns represent various attributes of these characters.

We can take a peek at the data with the `glimpse` function:

```{r glimpse-starwars, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
glimpse(starwars)
```

The first observation in the dataset is Luke Skywalker. The image below shows how the variables apply to him:

![Luke Skywalker](images/luke-skywalker.png)

## Scatterplots

How can we visualize the relationship between characters' heights and masses? Following the structure of the `ggplot` function that we laid out earlier, we pass `starwars` to the `data` argument, and map `height` and `mass` to the *x* and *y* `aes`thetics, respectively. Then, we specify on the next layer that we would like the data points to be represented by points with `geom_point`.

Fill in the blanks below to create the scatterplot.

```{r starwars-height-mass, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ___, mapping = aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  ___
```

```{r starwars-height-mass-solution}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r starwars-height-mass-check}
"Congrats on completing the exercise. Before you proceed, make sure your answer matches the solution."
```

Notice the warning that tells us that 28 of the observations have not been graphed, which means that some of the necessary information (height and mass) was missing for those rows.

```{r quiz1, echo = F}
quiz(
  caption = "Your turn!",
  question("How would you describe the relationship between height and weight?",
    answer("positive and nonlinear"),
    answer("positive and linear", correct = TRUE),
    answer("negative and nonlinear"),
    answer("negative and linear")
    ),
  question("How many outliers does the graph show?",
    answer("0"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("2")
  )
)
```

## Setting aesthetic features

So far we've only utilized the `x` and `y` arguments, but we can also set the `color`, `size`, `shape`, and `alpha` (transparency) of our data within the `aes` argument.

For example, here is the same scatterplot from before but with another added aesthetic: we map the color of each point to the observation's gender. Try changing the `color` parameter to another variable, such as `eye_color`.

```{r ggplot2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = T}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

Not every type of variable is suited to certain aesthetics. More specifically, continuous and discrete variables will be interpreted in different ways. Consult this table for guidance:

```{r aes_table, echo = F}
aesthetic = c("color", 
               "size", 
               "shape")
discrete = c("rainbow of colors",
             "discrete steps",
             "different shape for each")

continuous = c("gradient",
             "linear mapping betweebn radius and value",
             "shouldn't (and doesn't) work")

data.frame(aesthetic,
      discrete,
      continuous)
```

## Faceting your visualizations

Sometimes it's more appropriate to create multiple plots than to continue piling on different aesthetics to a single graph. Faceting is the use of smaller plots that display subsets of the data, which is particularly helpful when exploring conditional relationships.

If we decided that instead of employing the `color` aesthetic, we wanted to create separate scatterplots for each `gender`, we could add a `facet_grid` to the plot. Within the the `facet_grid` command, you must provide a "formula," which divides the graph vertically by what's to the left of the `~` and horizontally by whatever's to the right.

In this scenario, we use `.` to indiciate that we aren't utilitizing the left-hand side. Try flipping the formula around to have `gender` on the leftâ€”what happens to the visualization?
```{r ggplot3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = T}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) +
  geom_point()
```

What if we wanted to use both sides of the equation? See below where we create graphs for each combination of `gender` and `hair_color`. You'll notice that this isn't a very useful visualization, since there are enough hair colors to make our `height` axis too compressed to read, and many of the plots have no data. A key to visualization worth remembering is not to sacrifice the interpretability of a graph in order to squeeze in more information.

```{r ggplot5}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(gender ~ hair_color) +
  geom_point()
```

You can also take advantage of both dimensions of a plot while still limiting yourself to one variable. Instead of taking two variables and splitting them along axes like `facet_grid`, the `facet_wrap` command only takes one but wraps it in order to fit more plots without making them too thin:

```{r ggplot6}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_wrap(~ eye_color) +
  geom_point()  
```

## Data types

In the previous sections we were focused on graphing `height` versus `mass` in order to understand the relationship between them. However, it's often the case that we'd only like to focus on one variable (univariate) at a time so that we can understand how it's distributed.

Before picking visualization tools for our single variable, we need to understand what kind of data it is. If data is *numerical*, we can quantify it with a number. Within this class, data can be *discrete* or *continuous*. Discrete data usually describes something that's been counted and can't be made more precise, usually a non-negative integer. The number of children in a family is discrete because you can have 0, or 1, or 2 (and so on...) kids but not 0.5 or 1.1.

Continuous data on the other hand can take on an inifinite number of values within a stated range. Take height for example: while we usually round to the nearest inch, technically a person's height can take on an infinite number of positive values if you continue to be precise to more and more decimal places.

Pick which variables are continuous:
```{r continuous-quiz, echo = F}
quiz(
  caption = "Your turn!",
  question("Which numerical variables are continuous?",
    answer("The speed of a moving baseball", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The number of cupcakes I ate for breakfast"),
    answer("The temperature outside right now", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The temperature outside right now, rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree"))
)
```

If data isn't numerical then it is *categorical* (or *qualitative*), which means the data cannot necessarily be measured or quantified but still takes on distinct values. Categorical variables can be things you might observe with your senses, like colors or tastes, or labels like names of cities or people, or something more abstract like written text. Just because something is categorical doesn't mean it can't be sorted though: categorical data that is *ordinal* if it can be put in some sort of natural ordering, such as education levels (high school, college, grad school, etc.).

Pick which variables are ordinal:
```{r ordinal-quiz, echo = F}
quiz(
  caption = "Your turn!",
  question("Which categorical variables are ordinal?",
    answer("The color of a belt"),
    answer("The color of a karate student's belt", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The temperature outside right now, described as very cold, cold, hot, or very hot", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The weather outside right now"))
)
```

## Univariate analysis

When examining a numerical variable, we are often interested in its *distribution*, which describes the frequency with which the values in the variable's range are observed. A familiar distribution is the standard normal distribution:

```{r standard normal, echo = F}
data.frame(x = seq(-3,3, 0.01),
           probability = dnorm(seq(-3,3, 0.01))
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x ,probability)) +
  geom_line()
```

We can describe the shape of a distribution as symmetric if the shape is approximately mirrored around the middle, right-skewed if it has a long tail to the right, or left-skewed if it has a long tail to the left. We say a distribution is unimodal if it has one peak, bimodal if it has two peaks, multimodal if it has many peaks, or uniform if it has no peaks (a flat line). What are the skewness and modality of the normal distribution?

We can also measure the center of a distribution using the mean (the numerical average of the observations), the median (the observation with equal number of observations that are greater and less than it), and the mode (the most frequent observation). The mean, median, and mode for a normal distribution are all the same (0 in the standard case above).

We can measure the spread of distribution with the range (the most extremely high and low values), the standard deviation (how far the typical value is from the mean), and the inter-quartile range (the range of the middle half of the data).

Let's get back to visualization with `ggplot2`! To create a distribution for a variable, you only need to provide an `x` value to the `aes` argument (since the vertical axis is determined by the frequency of the `x` variable). From there you can visualize its distribution with `geom_histogram`. By definition, histograms create discrete buckets to categorize observations, the size of which are determined by the `binwidth` argument.

Here we create the distribution of the `height` variable in the `starwars` dataset. Try changing the size of the `binwidth`. Are there values that make it hard to understand that data?
```{r geom_histogram, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = T}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

If we know or suspect that a variable is continuous, we can use the `geom_density` geom to tell `ggplot` to estimate what a continuous curve for this variable would look like. These curves are usually "bumpier" than the theoretical distributions you might be used to because they are based on the actual data and must account for its particularities.

```{r geom_density}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density()
```

Of course, we know that data isn't always numerical, so `geom_histogram` won't be appropriate in some cases. For categorical variables, you can use `geom_bar`, which will create a bar chart with enough named categories to describe all the observations:

```{r geom_bar}
ggplot(starwars, aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Pick another categorical variable from the `starwars` dataset and create a bar graph for it. This time include `+ coord_flip()` at the end of the `ggplot` command. What happens?

```{r coord_flip, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = T}

```
